# GarageMate-DST-G1V1

Mount the GarageMate-DST to the Wall of your Garage and use the Indication Lights to Guide you as close as you like towards the Wall.
The Distance for the Red and Yellow LEDs are adjustable!

A 3mf File can be found here (includes the STL Files): [Makerworld - GarageMate-DST-G1V1 - Distance Indicator With LED](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1503847-garagemate-dst-g1v1-distance-indicator-with-led#)

## BOM (Bill of Material)
- 1x Arduino Nano
- 2x Potentiometer (K Value irrelevant)
- 2x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor
- 1x Red LED*
- 1x Yellow LED*
- 1x Green LED*
- 2x M2x4 (or M2x6) Maschine Screws (Head doesn't matter)
- Wire

Please note that you will need Resistors for the LEDs because the Arduino Nano Provides 3.3 Volts through the GPIO Pins which will fry the LEDs in the longrun!

You also need a Soldering Iron and some Solder. Make sure the Solder ist absolutly Ledfree! Dont buy (the cheapest) Solder if you dont know whats in it.
